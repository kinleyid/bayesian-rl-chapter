# Bayesian reinforcement learning models of addiction

This repository contains the Python code used to generate the results described in ["Impulsivity and Compulsivity in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning Models of Addiction: A Computational Critique of the Habit Theory"](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-55889-4_13) by Kinley and Becker, 2024. There is a little self-contained module called `rl.py` under `simulation-code/` that implements the model-based and model-free Bayesian RL algorithms described in the chapter. The other scripts each correspond to a different section in the chapter, as described by the comments they contain.

This code only relies on basic `numpy` functions so it should be fairly future-proof, but please let me know if anything stops working.
